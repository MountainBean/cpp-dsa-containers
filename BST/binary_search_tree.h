/* Sam Drew ~ 2025
 * Binary Search Tree implementation in C++
 * ---
 *  This is a simple implementation of a Binary Search tree. Written by me, 
 *  for my own edification in data structures and algorithms and C++.
 *  Class templating is used to allow the creation of Linked Lists of any 
 *  object type. This version uses CTAD (Class Type Argument Deduction) 
 *  and doesn't provide deduction guides so will only compile with C++20 or
 *  newer.

/* Binary Search Tree template class.
 *  
 *  Initialise with an object to create the first node of the tree.
 *  Use the included member functions to add to, remove from and search the 
 *  tree.
